# GitHub Workflows Setup Instructions

## Overview

Due to GitHub security restrictions, the workflow files cannot be automatically created in `.github/workflows/` by automated tools. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the complete CI/CD pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Copy Workflow Files
Copy the following files from `workflows-to-setup/` to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
cp workflows-to-setup/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp workflows-to-setup/release.yml .github/workflows/
cp workflows-to-setup/security.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 3: Configure Repository Secrets
Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

#### Required for Publishing:
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: Your crates.io API token
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Docker Hub password or access token

#### Optional for Enhanced Features:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov upload token for coverage reports

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: gh-pages (will be created automatically)

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Descriptions

### 1. `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main/develop

**Features**:
- âœ… Multi-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- âœ… Multiple Rust versions (stable, beta) 
- âœ… Feature matrix testing (default, postgres, all features)
- âœ… Code formatting and linting checks
- âœ… Security auditing with cargo-audit and cargo-deny
- âœ… Code coverage reporting
- âœ… Documentation building and link checking
- âœ… Performance benchmarking (main branch only)
- âœ… Cross-platform binary building

**What it does**:
- Validates code quality and security
- Tests across platforms and feature combinations
- Builds release-ready binaries
- Generates coverage reports
- Runs performance benchmarks

### 2. `release.yml` - Automated Releases
**Triggers**: Git tags (`v*.*.*`), manual workflow dispatch

**Features**:
- âœ… Version validation and changelog checking
- âœ… Full test suite execution
- âœ… Cross-platform binary compilation (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64)
- âœ… Docker image building (standard + security-hardened)
- âœ… SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- âœ… Automated GitHub release creation
- âœ… Crates.io publishing (stable releases only)
- âœ… Post-release task tracking

**Release Artifacts**:
- Cross-platform binaries with checksums
- Docker images on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry
- SBOM files (JSON and XML formats)
- Automated release notes from changelog

### 3. `security.yml` - Security Scanning
**Triggers**: Daily schedule (2 AM UTC), pushes to main, PRs to main, manual dispatch

**Features**:
- âœ… Vulnerability scanning with cargo-audit
- âœ… Supply chain security with cargo-deny
- âœ… Secret detection with TruffleHog
- âœ… Container security scanning with Trivy
- âœ… CodeQL static analysis
- âœ… Dependency review for PRs
- âœ… OpenSSF Scorecard analysis
- âœ… License compliance checking
- âœ… Cryptographic validation (custom checks for ZK crypto)
- âœ… Security summary reporting

**Security Validations**:
- Checks for hardcoded cryptographic values
- Validates use of secure random number generation
- Scans for deprecated cryptographic algorithms
- Verifies container image security
- Monitors supply chain integrity

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

The workflows reference several configuration files that should be created:

### `.github/dependabot.yml` (Already exists)
Automated dependency updates - already configured in your repository.

### `deny.toml` (Already exists)
Cargo-deny configuration for supply chain security - already present.

### `tarpaulin.toml` (Already exists)
Code coverage configuration - already configured.

## ðŸŽ¯ First Release Process

### 1. Prepare for Release
```bash
# Ensure version in Cargo.toml matches your desired release
# Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

# Example for v0.1.0:
# - Update Cargo.toml: version = "0.1.0"
# - Add section in CHANGELOG.md: ## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-XX
```

### 2. Create Release Tag
```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### 3. Monitor Release
- The release workflow will automatically trigger
- Monitor the Actions tab for progress
- Release will be created with all artifacts
- If secrets are configured, package will be published to crates.io

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "No CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret"
- Add your crates.io API token in repository secrets
- Token can be generated at https://crates.io/me

#### "Docker login failed"
- Verify DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD are correct
- For Docker Hub, use an access token instead of password

#### "Codecov upload failed"
- CODECOV_TOKEN is optional - workflow will continue without it
- Get token from https://codecov.io after connecting your repository

#### "PostgreSQL tests failing"
- PostgreSQL is automatically started for relevant test matrices
- Check if DATABASE_URL environment variable is properly set in workflow

### Getting Help:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Ensure all system dependencies are installed (handled automatically in workflows)
3. Verify that all referenced configuration files exist in the repository

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

After setup, you should see:
- âœ… Green checkmarks on all PRs
- âœ… Automatic binary releases on tags
- âœ… Security scanning reports in Security tab
- âœ… Code coverage reports (if Codecov configured)
- âœ… Published packages on crates.io (after first release)

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Metrics

The workflows provide:
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail status for all platform combinations
- **Security Reports**: Uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmark results in workflow artifacts
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage trends over time
- **Release Artifacts**: Binaries, checksums, and SBOMs for each release
