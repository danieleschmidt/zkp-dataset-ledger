# SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Compliance

## Current SLSA Level: Level 2 (Target: Level 3)

This document outlines the SLSA compliance measures for ZKP Dataset Ledger and the roadmap for achieving higher SLSA levels.

## SLSA Level 2 Requirements âœ…

### Build Requirements
- **Scripted Build**: âœ… Makefile and Cargo provide deterministic builds
- **Build Service**: âœ… GitHub Actions (when implemented) will provide hosted build service
- **Source Integrity**: âœ… Git provides cryptographic integrity

### Provenance Requirements
- **Available**: Generate build provenance for releases
- **Authenticated**: Signed provenance with GitHub OIDC tokens
- **Service Generated**: Provenance generated by CI, not by build script

## SLSA Level 3 Roadmap ðŸŽ¯

### Enhanced Requirements
- **Non-falsifiable**: Build platform ensures provenance authenticity
- **Isolated**: Build occurs in ephemeral, isolated environment
- **Connected by Provenance**: Clear link between provenance and artifacts

## Implementation Status

### Completed âœ…
- Cargo.lock committed for reproducible builds
- Security policy documented (SECURITY.md)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (cargo-audit)
- License compatibility checking (cargo-deny)

### Planned ðŸ“‹
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Reproducible builds verification
- Build provenance attestation
- Supply chain vulnerability monitoring

## SBOM Generation

### Automatic SBOM Creation
```bash
# Generate SBOM for current project
cargo cyclonedx --format json --output sbom.json

# Generate SBOM with vulnerability data
cargo audit --format json > audit-report.json
```

### SBOM Components Tracked
- Direct and transitive dependencies
- License information
- Version information
- CVE/security vulnerability status
- Build environment details

## Reproducible Builds

### Build Environment
```dockerfile
# Reproducible build environment
FROM rust:1.75-slim-bookworm
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    cmake clang pkg-config \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release --locked
```

### Verification Process
1. **Source Verification**: Git commit hash validation
2. **Dependency Verification**: Cargo.lock hash verification
3. **Build Environment**: Containerized, version-pinned environment
4. **Output Verification**: Binary hash comparison across builds

## Supply Chain Security Measures

### Dependency Management
- **Pinned Versions**: Cargo.lock ensures exact versions
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Daily cargo-audit runs
- **License Compliance**: cargo-deny validates license compatibility
- **Provenance Verification**: Planned cargo-vet integration

### Code Integrity
- **Signed Commits**: Recommended for maintainers
- **Branch Protection**: Required PR reviews and status checks
- **Secret Scanning**: TruffleHog integration
- **SAST Analysis**: Planned CodeQL integration

### Build Security
- **Isolated Builds**: GitHub Actions ephemeral runners
- **Provenance Generation**: SLSA provenance attestation
- **Artifact Signing**: Cosign integration for releases
- **SBOM Attachment**: Attached to release artifacts

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot integration
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub Security Advisories
- **Build Failures**: CI/CD pipeline alerts
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual dependency changes

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated vulnerability scanning
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis using SBOM
3. **Remediation**: Automated PR creation for updates
4. **Verification**: Re-run security scans
5. **Communication**: Security advisory publication

## Compliance Verification

### External Auditing
- **Annual Security Audit**: Planned for cryptographic components
- **SLSA Scorecard**: Automated compliance checking
- **Supply Chain Review**: Third-party dependency audit

### Self-Assessment Checklist
- [ ] All builds are scripted and reproducible
- [ ] Provenance is generated for all releases
- [ ] SBOM is attached to all releases
- [ ] Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned
- [ ] Build environment is isolated and ephemeral
- [ ] Artifacts are cryptographically signed
- [ ] Supply chain risks are monitored continuously

## Integration with Release Process

### Release Workflow
1. **Pre-release**: Run security scans and generate SBOM
2. **Build**: Reproducible build in isolated environment
3. **Attest**: Generate and sign SLSA provenance
4. **Publish**: Attach SBOM and provenance to release
5. **Verify**: Third-party verification of provenance

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify release integrity
cosign verify-blob --bundle <artifact>.bundle <artifact>

# Verify SLSA provenance
slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> --provenance-path <provenance>

# Verify SBOM
cyclonedx validate --input-file sbom.json
```
