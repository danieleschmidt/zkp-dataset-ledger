## Response Procedures

### Initial Response (First 15 minutes)

1. **Acknowledge**: Confirm incident receipt and assign severity
2. **Assemble**: Activate incident response team
3. **Assess**: Perform initial impact assessment
4. **Communicate**: Update status page and notify stakeholders

### Investigation Phase

#### Technical Investigation
```bash
# Gather system information
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
docker ps -a
systemctl status zkp-dataset-ledger

# Check logs for errors
journalctl -u zkp-dataset-ledger --since "1 hour ago"
tail -f /var/log/zkp-ledger/error.log

# Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep zkp-ledger)
iostat -x 1
netstat -tuln

# Database health check
zkp-ledger health-check --verbose
```

#### Security Investigation
```bash
# Check for unauthorized access
grep "authentication failed" /var/log/auth.log
grep "sudo:" /var/log/auth.log

# Network connections audit
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN
lsof -i -P -n

# File integrity check
find /opt/zkp-ledger -type f -newer /tmp/incident-start
checksums verify --config /etc/zkp-ledger/checksums.conf

# Cryptographic integrity
zkp-ledger verify-proofs --all --verbose
zkp-ledger audit-chain --from-genesis
```

## Specific Incident Types

### Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

#### Detection
- Automated proof verification failures
- Security researcher reports
- Dependency vulnerability scanners
- Anomalous proof generation patterns

#### Response Actions
1. **Immediately stop proof generation** if vulnerability is confirmed
2. **Assess impact** on existing proofs in the ledger
3. **Coordinate with cryptography team** for technical analysis
4. **Prepare security advisory** with timeline and impact
5. **Implement fix** and security patches
6. **Re-verify all affected proofs** if necessary

### Data Corruption

#### Detection Signs
- Merkle tree verification failures
- Inconsistent ledger state
- Proof verification errors
- Database consistency check failures

#### Response Actions
```bash
# Stop all write operations
systemctl stop zkp-dataset-ledger

# Backup current state
rsync -av /var/lib/zkp-ledger/ /backup/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)/

# Run integrity checks
zkp-ledger fsck --full-scan
zkp-ledger verify-chain --from-genesis --strict

# Restore from backup if necessary
systemctl stop zkp-dataset-ledger
rsync -av /backup/last-known-good/ /var/lib/zkp-ledger/
systemctl start zkp-dataset-ledger
```

### Supply Chain Compromise

#### Detection
- Dependency vulnerability alerts
- Unexpected binary behavior
- Build system anomalies
- Code integrity check failures

#### Response Actions
1. **Isolate affected systems** immediately
2. **Audit all recent deployments** and dependencies
3. **Verify binary integrity** against known-good checksums
4. **Review access logs** for unauthorized changes
5. **Rebuild from source** using verified dependencies
6. **Update all deployment keys** and certificates

### Performance Degradation

#### Monitoring Thresholds
- Proof generation >30s for 1M rows (normal: <10s)
- Verification time >100ms (normal: <10ms)
- API response time >5s (normal: <1s)
- Memory usage >80% of available
- CPU usage >90% for >10 minutes

#### Automated Responses
```bash
# Scale up resources (if containerized)
kubectl scale deployment zkp-dataset-ledger --replicas=3

# Enable emergency caching
zkp-ledger config set cache.emergency_mode=true

# Throttle incoming requests
zkp-ledger config set rate_limit.emergency_limit=10

# Clear non-essential processes
pkill -f "zkp-ledger benchmark"
pkill -f "zkp-ledger audit-historical"
```
