## Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permissions, the following require manual setup:

### Critical - Repository Function
1. **Copy workflow files**: `cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/`
2. **Configure secrets**: Add Docker, Codecov, and registry tokens
3. **Set branch protection**: Configure main branch protection rules

### Recommended - Enhanced Features
1. **Issue/PR templates**: Copy from docs/workflows/templates/
2. **Dependabot**: Create .github/dependabot.yml
3. **Repository settings**: Enable security features and discussions

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Complete SDLC Infrastructure**: Full development lifecycle support
2. **Security-First Approach**: Comprehensive security scanning and hardening
3. **Production-Ready**: Scalable deployment and monitoring
4. **Developer Experience**: Modern development environment and tooling
5. **Automation**: Extensive CI/CD and maintenance automation
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Workflow Setup**: Copy templates to .github/workflows/
2. **Team Configuration**: Set up teams and permissions
3. **Security Setup**: Configure secrets and scanning
4. **Monitoring Deploy**: Start monitoring stack
5. **Documentation Review**: Review and customize documentation

The SDLC implementation is now complete with enterprise-grade tooling, security, and automation!
