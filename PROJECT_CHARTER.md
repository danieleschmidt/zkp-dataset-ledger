# ZKP Dataset Ledger Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
To provide the first production-ready cryptographic ledger system that enables privacy-preserving auditing of machine learning datasets, establishing a new standard for AI transparency and regulatory compliance.

### Mission Statement
Develop and maintain an open-source zero-knowledge proof system that allows organizations to demonstrate dataset provenance, transformation history, and statistical properties without revealing sensitive data, thereby enabling trustworthy AI development and deployment.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement

Current AI audit frameworks require organizations to either:
1. **Share sensitive data** with auditors, creating privacy and security risks
2. **Provide unverifiable claims** about dataset properties, lacking cryptographic guarantees
3. **Maintain manual audit trails** that are expensive, error-prone, and not tamper-proof

This creates a fundamental tension between AI transparency requirements and data privacy obligations, particularly under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI governance frameworks.

### Solution Approach

The ZKP Dataset Ledger resolves this tension by providing:
- **Cryptographic proofs** of dataset properties without data disclosure
- **Immutable audit trails** with tamper-evident guarantees
- **Privacy-preserving verification** that satisfies both regulators and data subjects
- **Automated integration** with existing ML pipelines and tools

### Market Opportunity

**Target Markets**:
1. **Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant ML model auditing
2. **Financial Services**: PCI DSS and fair lending compliance
3. **Government**: Sensitive data AI deployments
4. **Enterprise AI**: Corporate governance and risk management
