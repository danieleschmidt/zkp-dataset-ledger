# ZKP Dataset Ledger - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The ZKP Dataset Ledger project delivers the first production-ready zero-knowledge proof system for cryptographic ML pipeline auditing. This charter defines the project scope, success criteria, stakeholder alignment, and strategic objectives to establish ZKP-based dataset provenance as the industry standard for AI transparency and compliance.

## Project Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement
*"To establish cryptographic dataset provenance as the foundational trust layer for responsible AI development, enabling verifiable compliance without compromising data privacy."*

### Mission Statement
*"We build production-grade zero-knowledge proof infrastructure that makes ML pipeline auditing cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving, and compliance-ready."*

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**1. AI Compliance Complexity**
- Regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, US Executive Order) require dataset provenance documentation
- Current solutions rely on manual documentation prone to errors and manipulation
- No cryptographic guarantees of dataset integrity throughout ML pipelines
- Privacy regulations conflict with transparency requirements

**2. Trust & Verification Gaps**
- Model auditors cannot verify dataset claims without accessing raw data
- No standardized way to prove dataset properties (bias metrics, statistical distributions)
- Lack of immutable audit trails for dataset transformations
- Difficulty tracking data lineage across complex ML pipelines

**3. Technical Limitations**
- Existing tools provide documentation without cryptographic verification
- Privacy-utility tradeoff forces choice between transparency and data protection
- No interoperable standard for dataset provenance across ML frameworks
