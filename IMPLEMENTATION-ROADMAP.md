## Manual Setup Requirements

Due to security restrictions, the following items require manual setup by repository maintainers:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
**Location**: `.github/workflows/`
**Templates**: Available in `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`
**Priority**: HIGH

Required workflows:
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration with testing and security scans
- `security.yml` - Advanced security scanning and vulnerability detection
- `release.yml` - Automated release with artifact generation
- `docs.yml` - Documentation building and deployment

### 2. Repository Settings Configuration
**Priority**: HIGH

Security settings:

- Configure branch protection on `main` branch
- Set up required reviewers for cryptographic dependencies
- Enable vulnerability alerts

### 3. External Service Integration
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Services to configure:
- Codecov for coverage reporting
- Security scanning services (Snyk, Trivy)
- Monitoring services (Datadog, New Relic)
- SBOM registry integration

### 4. Secrets and Environment Variables
**Priority**: HIGH

Required secrets:
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - For crates.io publishing
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - For container registry
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage reporting

   - **Mitigation**: Signed commits, SLSA attestations, secure runners

3. **Data Recovery Procedures**
   - **Risk**: Data loss during disasters
   - **Mitigation**: Regular DR testing, multiple backup locations

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance Regression**
   - **Risk**: New tooling impacts proof generation speed
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking, performance gates
